This project includes building a simple container from scratch.
It'll contain system,process and signals concepts. We'll use C++
to code the entire project. By the end of the 10 days you'll have
a strong understanding of how processes work behind the scenes and
the primary technology, NAMESPACES, that is used by Docker to
build containers.
